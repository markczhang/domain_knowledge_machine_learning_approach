# Summary

This project aims to acquire domain knowledge using machine learning methods and labeled datasets from different industry to understand what features are possibly to have high predictive influence.

The main approaches adopted in this project are: Feature Importance (both generated by Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) and Permutation Importance (generated by Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression).
